# Fundamentals of testing

### Why do we test?
* Testing and Risk?
  * Minimise Risk.
* Testing and Quality?
  * Want to give an indication of the software quality
* Exhaustive Testing?
  * Testing every option/combination of options.
  * Not really possible, too many options.

### Key Testing Terms
* **Error** (**Mistake**)
  * Human is responsible
  * Leads to
* **Defect** (**Fault**, **Bug**)
  * Problem with the code
  * Leads to
* **Failure**
  * The project not succeeding


* Effects a defect might have on a project
* Root cause vs. Effect

### Debugging Vs Testing
* Debugging - Used by developers to identify the cause of bugs or defects in code and undertaking corrections. (What has gone wrong? Can we fix it?)
* Testing - Systematic exploration of a component or system with the main aim of finding and reporting defects. (Has it gone wrong?)

### Other Things
* Glossary on ISTQB website
* Go by the book

## Seven Testing Principles
1. Testing shows the presence of bugs
2. Exhaustive Testing is impossible
3. Early Testing
  * Start testing as early as Product Requirements
  * Prevent any errors from getting too ingrained
  * Minimise cost to fix
4. Defect Clustering
  * Pareto Principle - 80% of defects are within the same 20% of code
  * Pockets of complexity
5. The pesticide paradox
  * Doing the same test over and over won't catch all the bugs
  * Need to change up testing frequently
6. Testing is context dependant
  * Need your tests to be appropriate to the product you're testing
7. Absence of errors fallacy
  * Just because you can't find errors doesn't mean there aren't any

### Developer/Tester Mindset
* The approach of a Tester
  * Need to be empathetic towards developers
  * Need to focus on quality/vision
* The approach of a Developer
* Using these different viewpoints to mitigate risk and increase quality
